# NYC Blog / CMS

One of my life dreams is to visit New York City, moved by that dream I created this app. This CMS allows writers to create articles about the Big Apple and admins to control which articles are published and to control the general aspects of the page, managing images and texts for different sections of the layout and the categories in which articles fall into. Readers can search articles by title, by category and also leave comments.

I created this app with Typescript, NextJS, GraphQL, Apollo, MySQL and CSS Modules. Tested with Cypress.

Its design and content belong entirely to Tracy Kaler's blog.
